This API has been created with Express, GraphQL, Sequelize and MySql.

To run the API you only need to execute the following command
npm run dev

Once the command is executed, you can click on the localhost link that is printed by console, and the GraphQL application will open to perform the different queries.

A part of the API is still missing because I was trying to solve the sending of data to the GraphQL response.

Thank you very much.
